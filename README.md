# Cline Documentation Management Prompt

This prompt enhances [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) (an autonomous AI developer agent) with a comprehensive documentation management system and structured development workflow.

## Overview

The prompt adds systematic documentation management capabilities to Cline by introducing:
- A structured documentation folder system
- Standardized document templates and formats
- Clear workflow instructions for documentation maintenance
- Systematic thinking and development steps

## Credits

This prompt is based on the original [Cline Docs concept by Nick Baumann](https://buildingblocks.space/post/C9UITs1BUX1wKfVDlyR4), with significant modifications to enhance:
- Document management procedures
- Development workflow steps
- Testing and verification processes

## Core Features

### Essential Documentation Structure

The prompt establishes a `cline_docs` folder containing four critical documents:

1. **projectRoadmap.md**
   - Tracks high-level goals and features
   - Records project progress
   - Maintains completion criteria
   - Logs completed tasks with dates

2. **currentTask.md**
   - Details current objectives
   - Provides context for ongoing work
   - Lists concrete next steps
   - Updates frequently with task progress

3. **techStack.md**
   - Documents technology choices
   - Records architecture decisions
   - Maintains overview of technical infrastructure
   - Tracks technology changes

4. **codebaseSummary.md**
   - Provides project structure overview
   - Documents component relationships
   - Tracks significant changes
   - Lists external dependencies
   - Integrates user feedback

### Enhanced Development Workflow

The prompt implements a structured development process:

1. **Systematic Document Review**
   - Enforced reading order for essential documents
   - Conflict resolution procedures
   - Regular documentation updates

2. **User-Focused Documentation**
   - Detailed instruction creation
   - Step-by-step guides
   - Clear code examples and commands

3. **Quality Assurance Integration**
   - Regular testing requirements
   - Functionality verification procedures
   - Documentation of test results

### Workflow Optimization

The prompt includes mechanisms for continuous improvement:

1. **Process Reflection**
   - Task efficiency analysis
   - Documentation effectiveness review
   - Workflow optimization suggestions

2. **User Feedback Integration**
   - Systematic feedback collection
   - Priority-based implementation
   - Impact documentation

## Usage

1. Copy the full text of the prompt into Cline's Custom Instructions field in settings
2. Cline will automatically follow the documentation management and development workflow defined in the prompt
3. The system will maintain the `cline_docs` folder structure and its contents according to the defined templates
